<p>Welcome to the controversy annotation system!<br /><br />


<div class="instructions group group1"> 

Here's a quick walkthrough of the task you'll be performing:<br /><br />

You will be offered a certain topic to annotate - it may be, for example, a concept, a person, etc. For this example, we'll annotate the topic "Jack Kevorkian". 
<br />
It's totally fine if you're not familiar with the topic - you'll get a chance to read more about it during the task.
It's also fine if you have personal opinions about the topic.
<br />
However, if you think the topic might make you feel uncomfortable in any way, feel free to skip it. You'll also be able to skip it partway if you change your mind later.
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">

</div>

<br />

Next, you'll be asked some questions about your familiarity with the topic and how controversial you think it is. Again, it's fine if you don't know!
<br />
If at any point you feel that you would like to skip this topic, there's a button at the bottom of the page that will let you skip to the next one.
<br />
For example, this annotator is somewhat familiar with Jack Kevorkian, and thinks that he is possibly controversial.
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task1--part1questions.png" />
</div>

<br />

On the next page, you'll be shown the Wikipedia article discussing the topic. Look for any parts in the Wikipedia article that mention a controversy (there may be none).
<br />
If you'd like to read more about the topic at this point, you can also use any other resources you'd like (such as a search engine).
<br />
If at any point you feel that you would like to skip this topic, there's a button at the bottom of the page that will let you skip to the next one.
<br />
In our example, the article on Jack Kevorkian is displayed.
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task1--part2shot1.png" />
</div>

<br />
On the same page, there will a series of questions regarding the topic. Feel free to go back to the Wikipedia article or any other resources if you'd like in order to answer these.
<br />
Do your best to answer each of the questions; if you're not sure, there's a "don't know" option.
<br />

In our example, after reading the Wikipedia article, the annotator thinks the topic involves sensitive issues, and that the Wikipedia article accurately reflects the level of the topic's controversy.  
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Part of the questions include some thought experiments. Also, you'll be asked about opposing stances (if any). Note that you don't need to exhaustively find all of them. In any case, no more than 5 stances will be requested.
<br />
In this example, two stances were listed by the annotator: "Kevorkian let people die in dignity" and "Kevorkian was a murderer". In both cases, people holding these stances would likely have a strong conviction regarding the topic.
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
You'll be asked a couple more questions to wrap up the survey, and you're welcome to give us any comments or anything else we should know about (although you don't have to!).
<br />
In any case, don't spend more than 10 minutes per topic - we'd much rather you do several topics than spend an extended time on any single topic. 
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />

Once you're done, you'll be offered to do another topic. Keep going until you'd like to stop. You can always come back later!
