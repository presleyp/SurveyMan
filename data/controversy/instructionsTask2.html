<p>Welcome to the controversy annotation system!<br /><br />


<div class="instructions group group1"> 

Here's a quick walkthrough of the task you'll be performing:<br /><br />

You will be offered a certain webpage to annotate - it may be, for example, a concept, a person, etc. For this example, we'll annotate a webpage titled "Sarah Palin" from a website called "Conservapedia". 
<br />
It's totally fine if you're not familiar with the topic the page discusses - you'll get a chance to read more about it during the task.
It's also fine if you have personal opinions about the topic discussed.
<br />
However, if you think the topic might make you feel uncomfortable in any way, feel free to skip it. You'll also be able to skip it partway if you change your mind later.
<br />
At this point, just skim the page to get an idea of what it discusses. Note that the page may be missing images and it may be out-of-date.
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task2--part1shot1.png" />
</div>

<br />

Next, you'll be asked some questions about what you think the page is about, your familiarity with the content of the page, and how controversial you think it is. Again, it's fine if you don't know!
<br />
If at any point you feel that you would like to skip this topic, there's a button at the bottom of the page that will let you skip to the next one.
<br />
For example, this annotator thinks the page's topic is "Sarah Palin", is very familiar with the topic, and thinks that this topic is possibly controversial.
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task2--part1shot2.png" />
</div>

<br />

<br />
Next, you'll be shown the webpage again. 
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task2--part2shot1.png" />
</div>

<br />
On the same page, there will a series of questions regarding connections between the webpage and Wikipedia articles. You'll be asked which of the Wikipedia article names seem to be on or off topic. Also, you'll be asked to choose the one article that best matches the webpage.  
<br />
<br />
Feel free to go back to the webpage or any other resources, such as a search engine, if you'd like in order to answer these.
<br />
Do your best to answer each of the questions; if you're not sure, there's a "don't know" option. 
<br />
If at any point you feel that you would like to skip this topic, there's a button at the bottom of the page that will let you skip to the next one.
<br />
<br />
In our example, after reading the webpage, the annotator thinks that most articles are highly on-topic, one is slightly on-topic, and isn't sure about one of the articles. The annotator chose the article "Governor Sarah Palin" as the best match for this webpage. 
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task2--part2shot2.png" />
</div>

<br />
Now, you'll be shown the webpage one last time and there will a series of questions regarding the topic. Feel free to go back to the Wikipedia article or any other resources if you'd like in order to answer these. 
<	br />
Do your best to answer each of the questions; if you're not sure, there's a "don't know" option. <br />
In our example, after reading the webpage, the annotator thinks the topic involves sensitive issues, and that the webpage makes the topic seem less controversial than it actually is. 
<br />
<br />

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task2--part3shot1.png" />
</div>

<div class="group">
<img src="instructions/ScreenShot--task2--part3shot2.png" />
</div>

<br />
<br />
Part of the questions include some thought experiments regarding a random sample of 100 pages on this topic. Note the subtle difference between the two questions: the first asks if the pages would agree with each other, and the second asks if they would agree with this webpage. 
<br />
You'll be asked a couple more questions to wrap up the survey, and you're welcome to give us any comments or anything else we should know about (although you don't have to!).
<br />
In any case, don't spend more than 10 minutes per topic - we'd much rather you do several topics than spend an extended time on any single topic. 
<br />
<br />

<br />
<br />
Once you're done, you'll be offered to do another topic. Keep going until you'd like to stop. You can always come back later!
<br >
That's it! <a href="entryTask2.php">Proceed to tool!</a>
